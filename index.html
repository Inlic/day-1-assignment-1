  <ol>
    <li>As a graduate student I worked in several biology labs with several animal models including: <span class="brown">mice</span>, <span class="striped">zebrafish</span>, and <span class ="red">red-flour-beetles</span></li>
    <li>I used to play the violin and I'm trying to learn the piano.</li>
    <li>I like to read, but I have a hard time finishing books that I start.</li>
